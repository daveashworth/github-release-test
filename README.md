# github-release-test

This is a throwaway repo used for testing auto changelog generation, auto push to github, and auto npm publish. Don't expect to gain anything useful from this repo. It's a wasteland of nothing.

Looking North in the wasteland however, you find an old parchment on the ground. Do you:

- (A) Pick it up?
- (B) Kick it and keep walking because I told you this was a wasteland.
